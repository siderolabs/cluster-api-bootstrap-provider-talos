CABPT supports config generation for Talos 0.12.
Talos majort version can be specified in the spec of `TalosControlPlane` or `MachineDeployment`:

```yaml
  generateType: controlplane
  talosVersion: v0.11
```

It is recommended to specify minor version of Talos to make sure machine configuration stays comptabile with Talos version
being used even if the CABPT is upgraded to new version.

In previous releases of CABPT default value of `talosVersion` field was `v0.8`.
As Talos v0.8 release is almost a year old, new default value of `talosVersion` is to use whatever Talos version CABPT was
built against (in this relase, it's Talos 0.12).

If you're still running Talos v0.8.x, please make sure `talosVersion` is set to `v0.8`.
